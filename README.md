This project implements Semantic Grammar Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The goal is to analyze text for grammatical structure and semantic meaning using Python-based NLP libraries and AI language models.

The implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook.

Objectives:
Analyze grammar and semantics of natural language text
Apply NLP preprocessing techniques
Use language models for deeper semantic understanding
Demonstrate practical NLP workflows for academic use

Technologies Used:
Python
NLTK
TextBlob
OpenAI / External Language Model API
Pandas
Matplotlib
